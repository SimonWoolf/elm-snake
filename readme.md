# Snake

Try it at http://simonwoolf.net/elm-snake/ :)

Nothing that hasn't been done before, just written to help teach myself Elm.

NB: to recompile, you'll need to apply a couple of fixes to elm-graphics: https://github.com/evancz/elm-graphics/pull/21 and https://github.com/evancz/elm-graphics/pull/20
